<body> 

Newton's laws of motion are three basic laws of classical mechanics that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws can be paraphrased as follows:
<br>
1.A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force.
<br>
2.When a body is acted upon by a net force, the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass is equal to the net force.
<br>
3.If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions. <hr color="red" size="4">

<body>   The first law of motion states that every body continues to be in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled by some external force to change that state.

<body>  <font size="14">
Newton's second law of motion states that F = ma, or net force is equal to mass times acceleration. A larger net force acting on an object causes a larger acceleration, and objects with larger mass require more force to accelerate.

<body>Newton's third law simply states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, if object A acts a force upon object B, then object B will exert an opposite yet equal force upon object A.
